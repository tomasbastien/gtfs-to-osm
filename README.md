# gtfs-to-osm
Provides tools that facilitate populating OpenStreetMap from GTFS datas
- GTFS stops to GeoJSON in order to project the generated file as a layer above OSM tiles to associate datas (for example in JOSM)
- GTFS shapes to GeoJSON lines in order to project the generated file as a layer above OSM tiles to associate datas (for example in JOSM)

GTFS files are intented to be stored uncompressed into a gtfs_datasets/ folder.

Theses files are mainly collected from FR gouv opendata platform https://transport.data.gouv.fr/
